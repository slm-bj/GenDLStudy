## Running Codes

Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and run:
```sh
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
uv run python <script>.py  # or:
uv run ipython music_transformer.ipy
```

## Music Generation Setup

Download [ó°Œ· AppImage](https://musescore.org/en/download/musescore-x86_64.AppImage)
of MuseScore and run:
```sh
chmod 755 MuseScore-Studio-4.4.3.242971445-x86_64.AppImage
cp MuseScore-Studio-4.4.3.242971445-x86_64.AppImage ~/.local/bin/
uv run python -m music21.configure
```

Then change path of MuseScore in ~/.music21rc as follows:
```xml
...
  <preference name="musescoreDirectPNGPath" value="/home/leo/.local/bin/MuseScore-Studio-4.4.3.242971445-x86_64.AppImage" />
  <preference name="musicxmlPath" value="/home/leo/.local/bin/MuseScore-Studio-4.4.3.242971445-x86_64.AppImage" />
...
```

Now durations and notes can be generated by running:
```sh
uv run ipython music_transformer.ipy
```
