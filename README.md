## Running Codes

Some Python scripts are converted from Jupyter notebook to avoid
Base64 strings messed up version history.
These scripts can be executed in 3 ways:

First as Python script:
```sh
cd scripts
poetry run ipython <script>.py
```

Or convert to Jupyter notebook and play with it interactively:
```sh
poetry jupytext --to notebook <script.py>
```

Lastly you can convert and execute it in one go:
```sh
poetry jupytext --to notebook --execute <script.py>
```

Choose one from them according to your needs.
